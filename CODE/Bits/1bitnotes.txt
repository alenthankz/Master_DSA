1<<i : pow(2,i) : ith position is set 
when i =1 : 5<<1 (multiply by 2) = 10 && left shify by 1 i,e  0101 becomes 1010

set a bit = mask|=1<<i;
unset a bit = mask^=1<<i;

imp:
number of set bit of x
if x is odd = 1+ no fo set bit of x/2;
if x is even = no of set bit of x/2 ( as it is just a left shift )

closest power of 2 to n  :  n&(n-1);
right most set bit       :  n&~(n-1);


Convert into binary string if necessary.
